## ✨ Core Concepts

### Explicit Composition
UI is built by composing small, predictable components.

### Modifiers
Modifiers are immutable, chainable, and explicit.
They control layout, drawing, interaction, and behavior.

### Theme-driven
Colors, typography, shapes, and elevation come from the theme,
not from hardcoded styles.

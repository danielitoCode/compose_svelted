## ✨ What is compose-svelted?

**compose-svelted** is an experimental but ambitious UI framework that brings the
**Jetpack Compose mental model** to the Svelte ecosystem.

It is **not** a Material Design clone, and it is **not** a thin component library.

Instead, it focuses on:
- explicit UI composition
- predictable layout
- declarative motion
- navigation as state

All built on top of **Svelte**, without virtual DOM abstractions or hidden magic.

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> UI is a function of state.  
> Layout, motion, and navigation must be explicit and predictable.

Key ideas:
- No implicit behavior
- No global side effects
- No magic context you cannot reason about
- Everything composes

---

## 🧱 Library Structure (High-Level)

### Core V1 – Layout & Styling
- Column, Row, Box
- Modifier (immutable, chainable)
- Shapes
- Theme system
- Typography

### Core V2 – Motion & Navigation (CLOSED)
- AnimatedVisibility
- AnimatedContent
- Declarative motion
- NavController
- NavHost
- Internal backstack

---

## 💪 Strengths

### Explicit Layout
Layouts are predictable and composable.

### Immutable Modifiers
Describe intent, not CSS.

### Structural Motion
Motion is part of the UI structure.

### Compose-like Navigation
Navigation without external routers.

---

## 🚀 Innovation

- Compose mental model on the web
- Navigation as state
- Motion as structure
- No virtual DOM abstraction

---

## 📦 Status

- Alpha
- Core V2 closed
- Core V3 planned

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

### Core V3
- Nested navigation
- Directional transitions
- Shared elements

---

## ⚠️ CSS Baseline (Required)

Compose Svelted assumes a neutral CSS baseline.

You MUST include the following reset in your app:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

html,
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```
